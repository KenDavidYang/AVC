            <p class="par">Established in February of 2001, under the name of CFS Printing Inc. it
                is basically organized to cater to all the printing requirements of the Sharp
                group of companies and its affiliates. After a year of acting practically as
                a support group, the management showed satisfaction with its
                performance in handling pressured projects and the team's ability to
                deliver on the dot.
            </p>
            <p class="par">Basing primarily on the group's effectiveness and efficiency, the CF
                Sharp management realized the team's potential to go out of its own, as
                an acknowledged entity, and be market competitive in the printing
                industry where it practically belongs.

            <p class="par">In the middle of 2005, the Printing Company changed its name to AVC
                Printing officially stands as one independent business entity under
                the new management headed by Mr. Jong V. Cuarteron. In 2015 its
                name was changed again to 1AVC Printing Inc. As its foremost policy,
                the company continues to render quality services, on-time delivery, and
